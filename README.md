HOW TO RUN THE GAME:<br>
1. Run 'pacman.bat'

Jared's Contributions:
- Created all graphics and splash screens
- implemented color
- implemented sound

Bobby's Contributions:
- all game functionality
- ghost pathfinding

KNOWN BUGS:
- If you don't eat the cherry and you die, it disappears from the map but you can still eat it and hear the noise and get the points if you go over the spot where it spawns.
- The waka sounds only work half the time on a real Windows machine (only one test case),  but they are fully functional on the Windows partition of a Mac (also one test case).
- If .\sounds is not in the correct directory, all sounds will be the Windows notification sound instead of what they should be.
